    <string name="jitendra_intro">
        Hello, I am Jitendra Rawat, a dedicated computer science graduate student at Pace
        University Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems in New York
        City. Originally hailing from the vibrant landscape of India, I bring a global perspective
        to my academic pursuits.\n\n

        I am currently immersed in pursuing a Master of Science (MS) in Computer Science with a
        specialization in Software Development at Pace University. My academic journey here has been
        marked by a strong commitment to excellence.\n\n

        Prior to my current academic endeavor, I earned my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree
        from DIT University in Dehradun, India, where I graduated in July 2020 with a CGPA of 6.69.
        This foundational education equipped me with a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals.
